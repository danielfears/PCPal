    <string name="case_description">The computer case, commonly known as the tower or base unit, is the enclosure in which all
        other components are contained. The aim of the case is to safely house all PC components in an environment
        in which air can flow freely to keep components cool.

    <string name="case_description2">Cases come in a variety of sizes, the most common being mATX (smallest),
        ATX (average) and full ATX (larger). Expensive cases offer builders more space, more auxiliary ports, and greater options for cooling.</string>
