    <string name="case_description">The computer case, commonly known as the tower or base unit, is the enclosure in which all
        other components are contained. The aim of the case is to safely house all PC components in an environment
        in which air can flow freely to keep components cool.</string>
    <string name="case_description2">Cases come in a variety of sizes, the most common being mATX (smallest),
        ATX (average) and full ATX (larger). Expensive cases offer builders more space, more auxiliary ports, and greater options for cooling.</string>

    <string name="motherboard_description">The motherboard, also known as mobo or logic board, is the main component in which all other components are connected.
    It functions as the carrier of all data between components, and provides ports for the user to plug in peripherals such as a mouse and keyboard.</string>
    <string name="motherboard_description2">Motherboards come in a variety of sizes, the most common being mATX (smallest) and
        ATX (average) and correlates to the size of case required. The motherboard is the first component to start when a PC is turned on,
        and is where runs initial PC checks are made.</string>

    <string name="cpu_description">The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer where all calculations are carried out, and is seated in the motherboard.
        CPUs come in a variety of different speeds (for example 2.4GHz) and socket size (which must match the same socket as the motherboard for example both using LG1150).</string>
    <string name="cpu_description2">There are two main producers of CPUs in the market today; Intel and AMD. Intel are regarded as the premium
    CPU brand and are usually more powerful and expensive. AMD produce entry-level CPUs which while being cheaper, are usually less powerful.
    Intel and AMD CPUs use different pin types, and therefore must use a compatible AMD or Intel style motherboard.</string>

    <string name="cooler_description">The CPU cooler is the primary source of keeping the CPU at an adequate temperature for operating at efficiency.
    As the CPU works harder it gradually gets hotter, and keeping the temperature under control can improve performance and longevity of the CPU.</string>
    <string name="cooler_description2">There are two main types of CPU cooler; air cooled which uses air flow to remove heat (which comes with the CPU with bought) and
    water cooled, which uses water contained in pipes to remove heat (bought aftermarket from a retailer.)</string>

    <string name="memory_description">Memory, commonly known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is the space used by software programs to store information being used by them.
        As applications are loaded up on a PC they require memory to function, and having more memory available to the computer means it can handle
    larger programs, or multiple programs at once.</string>
    <string name="memory_description2">Memory is available in different speeds (1600MHz is average) and generations (DDR3 or DDR4 are the current standard) as newer memory technology is released.
        Memory can be bought and used either separately or in pairs of two (dual-channel) in the capacity of 2gb, 4gb or 8gb capacity, with some motherboards having a maximum amount they can support.</string>

    <string name="powersupply_description">The power supply, also know as the PSU (power supply unit), is the component which supplies regulated electricity to
    the computer. The power supply connects to the motherboard using two auxiliary connectors and to external drives (storage/CD) using SATA and molex connectors.</string>
    <string name="powersupply_description2">Power supplies come in a range of strengths and quality ratings, where higher watt power supplies can service computers which
    draw more power, and the quality rating determines longevity and likelihood of failure, ranging from bronze to titanium.</string>

    <string name="harddrive_description">Storage devices are the components which store all of the data on a computer, ranging from personal files
    to the software required to run the computer (Operating System/drivers. This information is written to and read from the storage device at high speed.</string>
    <string name="harddrive_description2">There are two main types of storage device, Hard Disk Drives (HDD) which uses physical spinning disks to store data, and Solid State Drives (SSD)
        which uses flash memory like a USB to store data, the latter being much faster as no moving parts are involved.
    It is possible to use both in a computer, for example installing the Operating System on the SSD and using the HDD to store files.</string>

    <string name="gpu_description">The Graphics processing unit (or GPU), comes in two formats; onboard graphics, which is the GPU built into the CPU, and
    a graphics card, which is bought separately and plugs into the motherboards PCI-E slot, providing much greater graphics power by comparison.</string>
    <string name="gpu_description2">Graphics cards come with a variety of ports for plugging in multiple monitors.
        There are two main manufacturers of graphics card; ATI and Nvidia, and the more they cost generally the more power they can provide. Two or more graphics cards of the same type can also be used
        in the same system to provide extra power - either called SLI (Nvidia) or Crossfire (AMD).</string>

    <string name="cddrive_description">The CD drive provides the computer with a method of reading from and writing to physical disks. There are a variety of
    different drive types which offer to read and write from a greater variety of disk types such as CD and Blu-Rays.</string>
    <string name="cddrive_description2">CD Drives come in a variety of different sizes to fill various bay sizes, however the average is 5.25 inches.</string>

    <string name="os_description">The Operating System or OS, is the underlying software which provides the user with an interface and allows the computer
    to function, and is just as integral to the computer as the hardware. Core operating system files must not be altered once installed as this can break the computer.</string>
    <string name="os_description2">There are a variety of different operating system types such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS and Linux. Certain operating
    systems can only be installed on specific computers, such as Mac OS on Apple devices. The most common OS is Microsoft Windows, versions 7 and 8.1, with version 10 coming later this year.</string>

    <string name="satacable_description">SATA cables are the cable which directly connects the external drives to the motherboard and provides the transfer of data between the two components.</string>
    <string name="satacable_description2">Usually one is provided with the component which requires connecting together such as the hard drive, however aftermarket ones can be bought in a variety of different colours
        and sizes.</string>

    <string name="fans_description">Fans are the primary handlers of airflow within the PC case. Depending on the orientation of fans, they will either
    pull cold air into the computer case or draw hot air out from it, to regulate temperature. Cases come with one or two fans but more can be purchased
    to increased the effect, with diminishing returns. A typical fan setup would be to draw cold air in from the front, side and bottom, and push hot air out from the back and top.</string>
    <string name="fans_description2">Air pressure within the computer case should be positive (more air going in than being taken out), however there should be a rough balance of the two.
    Positive air pressure reduces amount of dust within the case while keeping the air cool.</string>

    <string name="step_one">Prepare all components for installation by removing all packaging and keeping them nearby</string>
    <string name="step_two">Take the case side off and lay down flat with the open facing up, keep screws organised</string>
    <string name="step_three">Wear anti-static wristband - attach to yourself and to the case on exposed metal</string>
    <string name="step_four">Place the PSU in the case, ensuring large fan facing out the bottom</string>
    <string name="step_five">Install IO cover into case for motherboard ports, push in till it clicks</string>
    <string name="step_six">Install motherboard grommets into case base for motherboard to sit on, using markers</string>
    <string name="step_seven">On motherboard before placing in, Lift clasp and remove CPU cover</string>
    <string name="step_eight">Gripping the sides, gently place CPU in gap (lining up shape) and secure clasp down</string>
    <string name="step_nine">Install memory into motherboard, pushing down sides until they click</string>
    <string name="step_ten">Place CPU cooler over CPU, pushed down the four pins until they are secure</string>
    <string name="step_eleven">Attach 3 or 4 pin CPU cooler cable to motherboard port labeled CPU</string>
    <string name="step_twelve">Place motherboard down on grommets, ensuring ports go through IO cover</string>
    <string name="step_thirteen">Screw motherboard down secure, until it does not move, but not too tight</string>
    <string name="step_fourteen">Insert CD drive into drive-bay and screw in at the sides</string>
    <string name="step_fifteen">Insert Hard Drive or SSD into drive-bay and screw in at sides</string>
    <string name="step_sixteen">Connect power supply cables to the relevant motherboard ports (see manual as they differ)</string>
    <string name="step_seventeen">Connect molex PSU cables to both the CD and hard drives</string>
    <string name="step_eighteen">Attach the case power and USB cables to motherboard (see manual as they differ)</string>
    <string name="step_nineteen">Connect drives to motherboard using the SATA cables provided</string>
    <string name="step_twenty">Put the case side back on, screw in tighly, then switch power supply on.</string>
