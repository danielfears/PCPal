# DevProject
Application for Development Project

This project focuses on the development of an Android application designed to teach people the core components of a personal
computer, and provide users with a checklist they can use to ensure when they build their own - they use the correct steps to
ensure a clean build, while not missing a step out. It is being built for a university project, and will hopefully be expanded
into a wider market at a later stage using originally sourced meterial.
